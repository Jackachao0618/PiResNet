# PiResNet: Data-driven Turbulence Modeling
This code implements an axample of multivariate regression problems in turbulence modeling —— a universal, inherently interpretable machine leanring framework [(IMLF)]() with the kernel of a physics-inspired residual neural network (denoted as [PiResNet](https://github.com/Jackachao0618/PiResNet)). Encouraging predictions are obtained, and in particular, physically realizable constraints are really statisfied for the first time using the [Progressive Iteration Realizability (PIR)](https://github.com/Jackachao0618/PIR) algorithm developed by C. Jiang. When building on this code and/or using aspects of IMLF and PiResNet, the following citations are suggested:
